## Purpose
To further develop my knowledge about applications in a container-based environment I wanted an application to run in this environment.
That's when I thought that a website would fit perfectly as a container.
The website also serves the purpose of being a centralized place to present information about my projects for future reference.
## Technology
The website is developed in Next.js with Typescript
**The technology chosen was made for the reasons listed below**

- The application requires the runtime environment to be able to execute code. A pure React application is able to run when served from a CDN.
Because I wanted to containerize the application, I wanted that my application would require a more sophisticated runtime environment.
- That the website would be served as generated files, witch will improve search engine optimization
- I wanted to further develop my knowledge of Next.js
### Artifact
The build pipeline generates a container that contains everything needed to run.
#### Container
The generated artifact uses **node:17-alpine** as is base-image
