## Purpose
I wanted to have a more enjoyable technology for when I wanted to touch the website for content updates.
Compared to the old website that was written in **Next.js**
## Technology
I wanted to work with **Rust** and chose a UI framework that I was invested in called [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/),
The codebase can be seen at my [github repo](https://github.com/lukashermansson/website) 

It is server side rendered and served running on top of Axum, that is the web-server framework I am most familiar with in the Rust ecosystem.
The style is all set up using tailwind classes, and they work pretty nicely in combination with `Leptos`.

### Artifact
The build pipeline generates a docker container, cross compield for the target achitecture (arm64) that is then deployed on my kubernetes cluster
