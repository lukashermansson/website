description: A rust library for convering swedish bank account numbers to Iban
tech: ['Rust', 'Open source']

## Purpose
I thought the problem would be interesting to solve and package into a library for others to be able to use

I decided that I wanted the code to be in a public repo, fully open source : [Swedish Iban Tool](https://github.com/lukashermansson/swedish_iban_tool)

## Tech
I wrote the library in Rust, as I wanted to practice my Rust skills (I really enjoy writing Rust code) and also, their ecosystem for dealing with libraries is amazing!

There is a bit of tests on the code, but it would be ideal to get a few more test cases with publicly available bank account numbers, any tips on this would be greatly appreciated

I have some plans to use the lib in some other rust application to show it of and provide some easy to use way to get the included functionality

### Rust ecosystem
The crate is available from here: [Swedish Iban Tool on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/swedish_iban_tool) and documentation with compile time verified examples can be found here: [swedish_iban_tool on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/swedish_iban_tool/0.0.1/swedish_iban_tool/)

## Open source
This is the first library I have made truly public and plan to keep maintaining.

It will be an interesting journey!
