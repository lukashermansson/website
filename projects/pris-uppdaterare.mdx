## Purpose
The purpose of the price notifier was to keep up to date of the price of my parents-in-law's residence, I offcourse wanted to keep up to date on
how the price evolved, so I created this little thing.

I decided that the code would be readable for all, please take a look at the code yourself: [PriceNotifier](https://github.com/lukashermansson/priceNotifier)

## Tech
I wrote the application in kotlin, as I enjoy writing kotlin and how easy it is to get a quick project like this one done.

I decided that it would be beneficial to abstract a few of the concepts to make this code usable with other sources and other notification mechanisms


## Architecture
Essentially this consists of two parts, the **fetchers**, witch are called on an interval, returning a price for something.
And the **Notifiers** that registers a subscription to a new highest price
It is built with spring boot, which in this case handles dependency injection, instantiation of notifiers, configuration and scheduling.

### Fetchers
Currently, only one fetcher exists, with this system a new one would be easy to add.
It is responsible for taking a url and knowing how to get the price information

An EraSweden price notifier exists currently, this one scrapes the html of the website to get the price currently.

### Notifiers
Multiple price notifiers can be registered simultaneously, it is built on an observer pattern, the notifiers are themselves responsible for registering with the Scheduler.

Currently the following notifiers exists:
Console notifier (Prints to console)
System tray Notifier (Sends a windows tray notification)
